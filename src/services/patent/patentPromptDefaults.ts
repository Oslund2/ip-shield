CORE NOVEL FEATURES:
\${features}

NOVELTY ASSESSMENT:
\${noveltyAnalysis}

INVENTION CONTEXT:
\${inventionDescription}

**CROWN JEWEL CLAIM PILLARS** - Focus claims on these 4 technical innovation areas:

1. **SELF-DOCUMENTING CODE ANALYSIS**
   - Parser that traverses abstract syntax trees (AST)
   - Extraction of function signatures, class hierarchies, data flows
   - Automated identification of patentable features from source code
   - Technical transformation: raw code -> structured patent-ready documentation

2. **AI-COMPLIANCE WORKFLOW ORCHESTRATION**
   - Multi-stage pipeline coordinating LLM calls with validation gates
   - Prompt templating with variable interpolation and version control
   - Structured output parsing with JSON schema enforcement
   - Rate limiting and retry logic with exponential backoff

3. **ASSET DECAY ALGORITHM**
   - Mathematical formula: decay_multiplier = max(floor_value, decay_rate^(episode_number - 1))
   - Cost optimization model tracking human editing time reduction over iterations
   - Configurable parameters for different production scenarios
   - Comparative analysis engine vs traditional methods

4. **PIPELINE ORCHESTRATION & STATE MACHINE**
   - Directed acyclic graph (DAG) of dependent generation tasks
   - Checkpoint/resume capability with persistent state storage
   - Multi-provider failover with automatic service switching
   - Progress tracking with granular status updates

**ALICE-DEFENSE LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS** (CRITICAL):
- Use "processor configured to execute" NOT "computer performs"
- Use "parsing abstract syntax trees" NOT "analyzing code"
- Use "transmitting via API endpoints" NOT "sending data"
- Reference SPECIFIC data structures (JSON schemas, database tables, cache layers)
- Include QUANTIFIABLE improvements (latency reduction, cost savings percentages)
- Describe TECHNICAL TRANSFORMATIONS (input data -> transformed output)

**AVOID THESE ABSTRACT PHRASES:**
- "managing", "organizing", "facilitating" (too abstract)
- "using AI to..." (not specific enough)
- "automatically generating" (needs technical HOW)

Generate exactly 2 independent claims:
1. One METHOD claim - Start with "A computer-implemented method for..."
2. One SYSTEM claim - Start with "A system comprising: one or more processors; a non-transitory computer-readable storage medium storing instructions that, when executed..."

USPTO FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Each claim MUST be a single sentence (use semicolons to separate elements)
- Use proper antecedent basis ("a/an" for first mention, "the/said" for subsequent)
- Method claims should use gerund form (-ing verbs) with TECHNICAL specificity
- System claims should list components with their CONCRETE functions
- Include at least one mathematical formula or specific algorithm reference
- Reference specific data structures by name (e.g., "hash table", "priority queue", "B-tree index")

Format your response as a JSON array of claim strings:
["claim 1 text...", "claim 2 text..."]`,

INDEPENDENT CLAIMS:
\${independentClaims}

AVAILABLE FEATURES TO COVER:
\${features}

**ALICE-DEFENSE STRATEGY FOR DEPENDENT CLAIMS:**
Each dependent claim should add TECHNICAL SPECIFICITY that anchors the invention to concrete implementation:

1. **Data Structure Claims** - Specify exact structures:
   - "wherein the cache comprises a least-recently-used (LRU) eviction policy"
   - "wherein the database schema includes a foreign key relationship between..."
   - "wherein the JSON schema defines required fields including..."

2. **Algorithm Claims** - Include mathematical precision:
   - "wherein calculating the decay multiplier comprises: multiplier = max(floor, rate^(n-1))"
   - "wherein the retry logic implements exponential backoff with jitter"
   - "wherein parsing comprises tokenizing using regular expression patterns"

3. **Technical Integration Claims** - Specify protocols/APIs:
   - "wherein transmitting comprises HTTP POST requests with OAuth 2.0 bearer tokens"
   - "wherein the storage medium comprises a PostgreSQL database with row-level security"
   - "wherein the rate limiting implements token bucket algorithm with configurable refill rate"

4. **Performance Claims** - Include measurable improvements:
   - "wherein the caching reduces API latency by at least 40%"
   - "wherein the asset decay model reduces human editing time by 15-20% per iteration"

Generate 15-18 dependent claims that:
1. Reference parent claims properly using "The method of claim X, wherein..." or "The system of claim Y, further comprising..."
2. Cover specific implementations with CONCRETE technical details
3. Include algorithm details, data structures, and protocol specifications
4. Provide fallback positions if independent claims face Alice challenges
5. Cover variations and alternative embodiments

USPTO FORMATTING REQUIREMENTS:
- Start each claim with "The [method/system] of claim [N]"
- Use "wherein" to add limitations or "further comprising" to add elements
- Maintain proper antecedent basis from parent claims
- Each dependent claim should add meaningful TECHNICAL limitations
- Include specific technical details (formulas, data structures, protocols)
- AVOID abstract language - be concrete and specific

Distribute claims: approximately 60% depending on claim 1 (method), 40% on claim 2 (system).

Each reference numeral is listed with its corresponding figure in the format: "XXX = Component Name (FIG. Y)"
- ONLY use reference numerals that are explicitly listed in the invention description above
- DO NOT invent or make up new reference numerals
- If a component is not listed with a reference numeral, describe it WITHOUT a reference numeral
- When no valid reference numerals are provided, describe components by name only without numbers

FIGURE REFERENCE REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL FOR CLARITY):
Every reference numeral MUST include its figure source to make the specification clear and unambiguous.
- On FIRST use of any reference numeral, ALWAYS include the figure in parentheses after the number
- Format: "component name XXX (FIG. Y)" where XXX is the reference number and Y is the figure number
- Subsequent uses in the same paragraph may omit the figure reference
- When transitioning to components from a different figure, always include the new figure reference

CORRECT EXAMPLES (with inline figure references):
- "As shown in FIG. 1, the AI pipeline 110 (FIG. 1) includes a Feature Extraction module 112 (FIG. 1)..."

TITLE: \${title}

KEY TECHNICAL FEATURES:
\${features}

INVENTION DESCRIPTION:
\${inventionDescription}

**USPTO ABSTRACT REQUIREMENTS:**
- Target 100-150 words (use the FULL allowance for maximum technical detail)
- MUST be a single paragraph with no line breaks
- Written in third person, present tense
- No marketing language or subjective claims
- No legal claims language ("comprising", "wherein")
- Should NOT start with "The present invention" or "This invention"
- Do NOT include reference numerals (e.g., "100", "102") in the abstract

**CONTENT REQUIREMENTS (in order of priority):**

1. **OPENING (1 sentence):** State what the invention IS
   - Identify whether it's a system, method, apparatus, or combination
   - Name the primary technical function
   - Example: "A computer-implemented system for automated software intellectual property analysis and patent application generation..."

2. **CORE ARCHITECTURE (2-3 sentences):** Describe the KEY technical components
   - Name the major modules, components, and their specific functions
   - Explain how components interact or how data flows through the system
   - Include specific technical elements (APIs, algorithms, data structures, processing steps)
   - Use technical terminology appropriate to the field
   - Be SPECIFIC, not generic - name actual technical approaches

3. **KEY INNOVATION (1-2 sentences):** Highlight what makes this novel
   - Describe the unique technical approach or combination
   - Mention specific algorithms, methods, or architectures if applicable
   - Reference quantifiable improvements or unique capabilities

4. **TECHNICAL RESULT (1 sentence):** State the technical outcome
   - What does the system achieve technically?
   - What problem is solved and how?

**QUALITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- The abstract MUST describe technical structure, not just purpose
- The abstract MUST mention at least 4-5 specific technical components or steps
- An engineer reading this abstract should understand what the system does
- The abstract should be substantive enough to differentiate from prior art
- Use all 150 words - brevity is NOT the goal, completeness IS

**EXAMPLE OF PROPER TECHNICAL DEPTH:**
"A computer-implemented system for automated software intellectual property analysis and patent application generation comprising a codebase analysis engine, a feature extraction processor, a prior art search coordinator, and a multi-stage specification generator. The codebase analysis engine parses source code repositories using abstract syntax tree traversal to extract function signatures, class hierarchies, and data flow patterns. The feature extraction processor identifies patentable features by analyzing code structure, API interfaces, and algorithmic innovations. The prior art search coordinator queries patent databases and performs novelty scoring against identified features. The multi-stage specification generator produces USPTO-compliant patent sections including claims, detailed descriptions, and abstracts using AI-driven text generation with structured output validation. The system enables end-to-end automated patent drafting while maintaining legal compliance through integrated validation workflows."

Generate ONLY the abstract text. Do not include any heading, label, word count, or commentary.`,

INVENTION TITLE: \${title}

CLAIMS:
\${claims}

KEY FEATURES:
\${features}

INVENTION DESCRIPTION:
\${inventionDescription}

**ALICE/MAYO TWO-STEP ANALYSIS:**

STEP 1: Is the claim directed to a judicial exception?
- Abstract ideas (fundamental economic practices, mathematical concepts, mental processes, methods of organizing human activity)
- Laws of nature
- Natural phenomena

STEP 2: If yes, does the claim recite additional elements that amount to "significantly more"?
- Improvements to computer functionality
- Specific technical implementations
- Unconventional arrangements of known elements
- Transformation of data into a different state

**EVALUATE EACH CLAIM FOR:**

1. **Abstract Idea Risk** (High/Medium/Low)
   - Is it describing a business method?
   - Is it a mathematical concept without technical application?
   - Could it be performed mentally or with pen and paper?

2. **Technical Anchoring Strength** (Strong/Moderate/Weak)
   - Does it reference specific hardware components?
   - Does it describe concrete data structures?
   - Does it include specific algorithms with technical effect?

3. **Improvement Evidence** (Present/Partial/Absent)
   - Does it improve computer functionality itself?
   - Does it solve a technical problem in a technical way?
   - Does it describe unconventional technical steps?

**RISK INDICATORS TO FLAG:**
- Generic computer implementation language ("using a computer to...")
- Abstract verbs without technical specificity ("managing", "organizing", "facilitating")
- Missing hardware/data structure references
- Business outcome focus vs technical outcome focus

**PROVIDE:**
1. Overall Alice Risk Score (0-100, where 0 = no risk, 100 = high rejection risk)
2. Risk level for each independent claim
3. Specific vulnerable phrases identified
4. Recommended language improvements
5. Technical anchoring suggestions
